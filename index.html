        In 1988, the malware known as Morris worm was launched from a computer at Cornell University, by graduate student Robert Tappan Morris. The worm spread to all internet-connected computers and was designed to be undetectable. A design flaw led it to create more copies than Morris could control, which ultimately led to its detection.
